DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), data from an Air Force Reserve Unit
Hurricane Hunter aircraft and NOAA Doppler weather radars from
indicate that Florence was located near latitude 33.4 North,
longitude 75.5 West.  Florence is moving toward the northwest near
10 mph (17 km/h).  This general motion, accompanied by a further
decrease in forward speed, is expected to continue through today. A
turn to the west-northwest and west at an even slower forward speed
is expected tonight and Friday, and a slow west-southwestward motion
is forecast Friday night and Saturday.  On the forecast track, the
center of Florence will approach the coasts of North and South
Carolina later today, then move near or over the coast of southern
North Carolina and northeastern South Carolina in the hurricane
warning area tonight and Friday. A slow motion across portions of
eastern South Carolina is forecast Friday night through Saturday
night.
Data from the aircraft and Doppler weather radars indicate that
maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 105 mph (165 km/h)
with higher gusts. Little change in strength is expected before the
center reaches the coast, with weakening expected after the center
moves inland.
Florence is a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend outward
up to 80 miles (130 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force
winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km). NOAA Buoy 41025,
located near Diamond Shoals, North Carolina, recently reported a
sustained wind of 54 mph (87 km/h).
The latest minimum central pressure based on data from the aircraft
is 955 mb (28.20 inches).
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water has the
potential to reach the following heights above ground if peak surge
occurs at the time of high tide...
Cape Fear NC to Cape Lookout NC, including the Neuse, Pamlico,
Pungo, and Bay Rivers...9-13 ft
North Myrtle Beach SC to Cape Fear NC...6-9 ft
Cape Lookout NC to Ocracoke Inlet NC...6-9 ft
South Santee River SC to North Myrtle Beach SC...4-6 ft
Ocracoke Inlet NC to Salvo NC...4-6 ft
Salvo NC to North Carolina/Virginia Border...2-4 ft
Edisto Beach SC to South Santee River SC...2-4 ft
RAINFALL: Florence is expected to produce heavy and excessive
rainfall in the following areas...
Coastal North Carolina into far northeastern South Carolina...20 to
30 inches, isolated 40 inches. This rainfall will produce
catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river
flooding.
Remainder of South Carolina and North Carolina into southwest
Virginia...6 to 12 inches, isolated 24 inches.
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area this evening or early Friday.  Tropical
storm conditions are already moving onshore within the warning
area.
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible in eastern North Carolina
through Friday.
SURF:  Swells generated by Florence are affecting Bermuda, portions
of the U.S. East Coast, and the northwestern and central Bahamas.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
