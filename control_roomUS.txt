DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Florence was
located near latitude 32.0 North, longitude 73.7 West. Florence is
moving toward the northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h), and this general
motion, accompanied by a gradual decrease in forward speed, is
expected to continue through Thursday.  A turn to the west-northwest
and west at an even slower forward speed is expected Thursday
night and Friday, and a slow west-southwestward motion is forecast
Friday night and Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Florence will approach the coasts of North and South Carolina on
Thursday, then move near or over the coast of southern North
Carolina and eastern South Carolina in the hurricane warning area on
Thursday night and Friday.  A slow motion over eastern South
Carolina is forecast Friday night and Saturday.
Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft
indicate that maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 110 mph
(175 km/h) with higher gusts.  Florence is now a category 2
hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind scale.  Little
change in strength is expected before the center reaches the coast,
with weakening expected after the center moves inland.
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km).
The latest minimum central pressure reported by the Hurricane
Hunter aircraft is 957 mb (28.26 inches).
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water has the
potential to reach the following heights above ground if peak surge
occurs at the time of high tide...
Cape Fear NC to Cape Lookout NC, including the Neuse, Pamlico,
Pungo, and Bay Rivers...9-13 ft
North Myrtle Beach SC to Cape Fear NC...6-9 ft
Cape Lookout NC to Ocracoke Inlet NC...6-9 ft
South Santee River SC to North Myrtle Beach SC...4-6 ft
Ocracoke Inlet NC to Salvo NC...4-6 ft
Salvo NC to North Carolina/Virginia Border...2-4 ft
Edisto Beach SC to South Santee River SC...2-4 ft
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
RAINFALL:  Florence is expected to produce heavy and excessive
rainfall in the following areas...
Coastal North Carolina...20 to 30 inches, isolated 40 inches. This
rainfall would produce catastrophic flash flooding and significant
river flooding.
South Carolina, western and northern North Carolina...5 to 10
inches, isolated 20 inches.
Elsewhere in the Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic states...3 to 6
inches, isolated 12 inches.
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area late Thursday or Friday.  Winds are
expected to first reach tropical storm strength on Thursday, making
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to
protect life and property should be rushed to completion.
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible in eastern North Carolina
through Friday.
SURF:  Swells generated by Florence are affecting Bermuda, portions
of the U.S. East Coast, and the northwestern and central Bahamas.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
