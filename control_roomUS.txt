DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Florence was located
by satellite near latitude 28.0 North, longitude 67.9 West.
Florence is moving toward the west-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h).
A motion toward the west-northwest and northwest is expected through
early Thursday.  Florence is expected to slow down considerably by
late Thursday into Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Florence will move over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean between
Bermuda and the Bahamas through Wednesday, and approach the coast of
North Carolina or South Carolina in the hurricane warning area on
Thursday and Friday.
Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Florence is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Strengthening is forecast tonight and
Wednesday.  While some weakening is expected on Thursday, Florence
is forecast to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through
landfall.
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km).
The estimated minimum central pressure is 945 mb (27.91 inches).
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water has the
potential to reach the following heights above ground if peak surge
occurs at the time of high tide...
Cape Fear to Cape Lookout, including the Neuse and Pamlico
Rivers...9-13 ft
North Myrtle Beach to Cape Fear...6-9 ft
Cape Lookout to Ocracoke Inlet...6-9 ft
South Santee River to North Myrtle Beach...4-6 ft
Ocracoke Inlet to North Carolina/Virginia Border...4-6 ft
Edisto Beach to South Santee River...2-4 ft
RAINFALL: Florence is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 15 to 25 inches with isolated maximum amounts of
35 inches near the storm's track over portions of the Carolinas and
Mid-Atlantic States from late this week into early next week.  This
rainfall would produce catastrophic flash flooding and significant
river flooding.
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area on Friday.  Winds are expected to first
reach tropical storm strength on Thursday, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
SURF:  Swells generated by Florence are affecting Bermuda and
portions of the U.S. East Coast.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
