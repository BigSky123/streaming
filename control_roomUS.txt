DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Florence was
located near latitude 24.8 North, longitude 53.2 West. Florence is
moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general motion
is expected to continue for the next couple of days.  A west-
northwestward motion with an increase in forward speed is expected
during the early-to-middle part of next week.  On the forecast
track, the center of Florence will move over the waters of the
southwestern Atlantic Ocean through Wednesday.
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts. Little change in intensity is expected during
the next day or so, but restrengthening is forecast over the
weekend. Florence is forecast to become a hurricane again Sunday
and a major hurricane early next week.
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Florence are affecting Bermuda and will
reach portions of the U.S. East Coast over the weekend.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
